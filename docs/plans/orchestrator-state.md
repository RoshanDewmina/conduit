# Orchestrator state — Fable swarm dashboard

**Updated:** 2026-07-11 (update after every merge or blocker; this file is compaction insurance)
**Phase:** 0 — git hygiene (complete pending push + owner digest) → Phase 1 dogfood MVP next
**Roadmap SSOT:** `docs/product/2026-07-10-lancer-agent-build-roadmap.md` · direction:
`docs/product/2026-07-10-lancer-daily-driver-definition.md`

## Model slugs (verified via `agent models`, 2026-07-11)

| Role | Slug |
|---|---|
| Default implementer | `grok-4.5-xhigh` (Cursor Grok 4.5; `grok-4.5-fast-xhigh` when speed matters) |
| Mechanical edits / first-pass review summaries | `composer-2.5` |
| Fallback + sensitive + repo-skill work | Claude `sonnet` high via Agent tool |
| Cursor auth | logged in (sidewhinder2k3@gmail.com); `gh` auth OK (RoshanDewmina, repo=conduit) |

## Phase 0 log (2026-07-11)

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Empty-tree tip repaired** | DONE | `1c102940` had tree `4b825dc6…` (the empty tree — wiped index at commit time). Backup ref `backup/w0a-empty-tree-tip`; `git reset --mixed bd4bcef8`; recommitted as `4c350a52` (869 files in tree) |
| Dispatch cwd fix landed | DONE | `4c2634df` fix(daemon): fail-fast missing/non-dir cwd (`resolveDispatchCWD`); `go test ./...` ok (lancerd 44s + policy); Fable full-diff review passed (sensitive path) |
| Scorched-wipe worktree removed | DONE | worktree was clean, on master; branch `feat/frontend-scorched-wipe` tip `80407933` verified ancestor of master → `-D` deleted. Frontend KEPT = W0.A CursorStyle shell (present on this branch) |
| build_sim green | DONE | XcodeBuildMCP build_sim SUCCEEDED 29.8s on `feat/chat-overhaul-w0a` (post-repair). Warnings only: `Lancer/SiriRelevanceCoordinator.swift` unused `try?` / var-never-mutated ×25 — queued as Composer cleanup |
| REVIEW_STANDARDS.md | DONE | created, seeded from ENGINEERING_PROCESS review bar + verdict JSON contract |
| claude-code-action workflow | DONE (blocked on secret) | `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml`; **owner must `gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY -R RoshanDewmina/conduit`** — repo has no secrets |

## Branch / worktree state

- `feat/chat-overhaul-w0a` — active, tree clean (only untracked: owner's personal
  `visual-first-communication.md`, left alone). Ahead of origin; push pending.
- Stashes kept until W0.A merges: `stash@{0}` (W0.A 19-file checkpoint), `stash@{1}` (pairing
  fixes) — content believed landed in branch commits; verify before dropping.
  `checkpoint/w0a-dogfood-pre-scorched-wipe` + `backup/w0a-empty-tree-tip` refs kept.
- Stale worktrees under `.worktrees/` (a3-r*, chat-*, w0-*, push-gaps, fix-daemon-flake) —
  audit each for unmerged work before removal; NOT part of Phase 0 scope.
- `claude/amazing-mayer-246fef`: cherry-pick only, never wholesale-merge.

## Owner-gated queue

1. Merge `feat/chat-overhaul-w0a` → master (ui risk + daily-loop change ⇒ owner gate).
2. Tier 0 / 5c device re-proof on current tip (physical phone).
3. `gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the PR reviewer workflow.
4. Start `docs/dogfood-log.md` (one line/day).

## Decisions log

- 2026-07-11: dispatch.go dirty change was pre-existing dogfood-fix work found in tree during
  repair; landed as its own commit after Fable full-diff review + go gate (no argv/vendor
  changes, cwd validation only — vendor-cli-adapter-audit concerns not implicated).
- 2026-07-11: stashes NOT popped — branch commits supersede; keep as safety until merge.

## Phase 1 lanes (next — spec before dispatch)

Six pieces per roadmap §1: pairing/trusted machines · thread list · chat thread finesse ·
composer · push approvals incl. lock screen · emergency stop. Disjoint write-sets; shared
files (Package.swift, project.yml) land first as tiny solo commits.
