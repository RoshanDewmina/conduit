# Chat parity checklist — Lancer vs Claude mobile & Codex

> Scorecard for the phone **chat experience** as Lancer moves to being driven primarily from the
> phone. Tracks feature parity with **Claude mobile** (claude.ai iOS) and **Codex** (ChatGPT Codex
> web + Codex CLI). Status: ✅ done · 🟡 partial · ⬜ planned · ⛔ n/a (control-plane, with reason).
> Flip cells as phases land. Source plan: `~/.claude/plans/im-going-to-move-giggly-minsky.md`.

Lancer is a **governed control plane for coding agents**, not a general chatbot — so some
Claude/Codex features are deliberately `⛔ n/a`. Those are recorded with a reason, never silently
dropped, so "not built" never reads as an oversight.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Push notifications | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | P0 | APNs wired; device-loop proof pending |
| Approve/deny from notification | ⬜ | ⬜ | 🟡 | P0 | Lancer governance edge; Phase 5c runbook |

| Image generation | ✅ | ⬜ | ⛔ | — | n/a for a coding control plane |

## Priority rollup
- **P0:** ✅ markdown + code blocks + copy · ✅ `/` autocomplete · ✅ resume from history.
- **P1:** ✅ inline composer · ✅ search/rename/delete · ✅ relay command-forwarding · ✅ model picker · _todo:_ wider artifacts.
- **P2:** ✅ syntax highlight · ✅ regenerate · ✅ share/export · ✅ edit/resend · ✅ pin · ✅ @-mentions.

**Status: chat surface is feature-complete vs Claude/Codex for a control plane.** Everything not
✅ is either `⛔ n/a` (voice, image-gen, web search — wrong product) or low-value tail (wider
artifact cards). Remaining work is the **on-device QA pass** (`chat-device-test-checklist.md`) and
the **governed-loop launch gate** (`LIVE_LOOP_RUNBOOK.md` Phase 5c).
