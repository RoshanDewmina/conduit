# Chat parity checklist — Lancer vs Claude mobile & Codex

> Scorecard for the phone **chat experience** as Lancer moves to being driven primarily from the
> phone. Tracks feature parity with **Claude mobile** (claude.ai iOS) and **Codex** (ChatGPT Codex
> web + Codex CLI). Status: ✅ done · 🟡 partial · ⬜ planned · ⛔ n/a (control-plane, with reason).
> Flip cells as phases land. Source plan: `~/.claude/plans/im-going-to-move-giggly-minsky.md`.

Lancer is a **governed control plane for coding agents**, not a general chatbot — so some
Claude/Codex features are deliberately `⛔ n/a`. Those are recorded with a reason, never silently
dropped, so "not built" never reads as an oversight.
